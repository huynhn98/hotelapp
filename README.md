This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or use npm

Install the dependencies (this is not the same as installing NPM or Yarn) with:
```bash
# Make sure you are in the working directory with the package.json file
yarn install
# or
npm install
``` 

Setup a .env file and add a APPLICATION_SECRET variable with a 32 length string
```bash
APPLICATION_SECRET=your32lengthrandomstring
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

You can close the server with ctrl+c in the terminal window

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
